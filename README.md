## Fake News Detection Using Sentiment and Emotion Analysis
### Overview
This project investigates the use of sentiment and emotion features to improve fake news detection accuracy. Using the publicly available ISOT Fake News Dataset, we extract lexicon-based sentiment and emotion features alongside traditional text features to train and evaluate multiple machine learning classifiers.

The goal is to determine whether incorporating emotional cues enhances the classification of fake versus real news, and to identify which emotions are most indicative of misinformation.


### Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline including text cleaning and lemmatization.
- Sentiment scoring using TextBlob.
- Emotion extraction using the NRC Emotion Lexicon via the NRCLex Python library.
